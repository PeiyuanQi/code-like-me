# Node / npm: Use nvm 24

When running **any Node or npm operation** in this project, **use Node 24 via nvm** first.

## Before npm / yarn / pnpm

Run in the shell (or ensure it’s already run in the session):

```bash
nvm use 24
```

Then run your package-manager commands as usual.

## Examples

```bash
nvm use 24
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```

```bash
nvm use 24
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Do **not** run `npm install`, `npm run ...`, `yarn`, or `pnpm` without using Node 24 (e.g. `nvm use 24`) in this project.
